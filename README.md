## Data Fetching With Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query)

This small project primarily includes the setup and use of Redux Toolkit for advanced data fetching with real world scenarios.

## Functionalities

Three different frontend API calls for data fetching (list of products) with real world scenarios.

1. Basic query - to fetch all products at once and list them
2. Paginated query - to enable pagination with the list
3. Infinite query - to enable infinite loading with the list

Note: Open source mock backend APIs from http://dummyjson.com have been used for this purpose.
